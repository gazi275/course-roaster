#  Course Registration


Welcome to our course learning platform! This website offers a diverse range of courses in C, C++, SQL, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Engineering (SWE). Below, we highlight three key features of our platform:

## 1. Dynamic Course Loading from API

- **Description:** Our platform dynamically loads course data from an API, ensuring that you have access to the latest course listings. This includes details such as course titles, descriptions, prices, and credit hours.

- **Benefits:**
  - Always up-to-date course offerings.
  - A seamless user experience with real-time course information.
  - Scalability for adding or modifying courses without changing the website's codebase.

## 2. Credit Hour Alert for Lengthy Courses

- **Description:** We've implemented a feature that checks the credit hours of each course. If a course exceeds 20 hours in credit time, it triggers a user-friendly alert or notification.

- **Benefits:**
  - Informed decision-making about course selection based on time commitments.
  - Encouragement to manage course loads effectively.
  - Enhanced user experience with transparency about course durations.

## 3. Personalized Course Recommendations

- **Description:** Our platform includes a recommendation system that offers personalized course suggestions based on user interests, previous courses taken, and browsing history.

- **Benefits:**
  - Improved user engagement through tailored course recommendations.
  - Discovery of relevant courses users may not have considered otherwise.
  - Enhanced user retention and satisfaction with a user-centric content discovery experience.




### Answer No-2:


 ### In home.jsx
- **useState**: 

 I've used the useState hook to manage the state of the course data. I  have a course state variable that holds an array of course objects. This state variable is initialized with an empty array or fetched from an API.

- **useEffect:** I've used the useEffect hook in home.jsx to fetch or update the course data when the component mounts or when certain dependencies change. For example, when the component first loads, I have use useEffect to fetch the initial list of course-details from an API.

- **Passing Data to Child Components:** I've passed the courses state down to child components like card.jsx as props. Each course card in the list is generated by mapping through the courses array and rendering a card.jsx component for each course, passing the relevant data as props.

### card.jsx - Individual course Cards:

- **Props:** In card.jsx,I  receive the course information (e.g., course name, price, image, etc.) as props. These props are used to render the individual course cards.

- **Add to Cart:** I have an "select" button or functionality within card.jsx. When this button is clicked, it triggers a function passed down as a prop from home.jsx to add the selected course to the cart.

### cart.jsx - 

- **State:** In cart.jsx, I manage the state of the courses cart. This state includes an array of selected courses (added from card.jsx) and their quantities.

- **Props:** I  pass down the selected courses and quantities from the cart state in home.jsx to cart.jsx as props. This allows Ito display the selected items and quantities in the cart component.

- **Update Cart:** When a user interacts with the cart (e.g., removing items or changing quantities), I have functions or callbacks that update the cart state. These functions may be passed from cart.jsx to home.jsx, where the main cart state resides.

-  **Display Cart Contents:** cart.jsx renders the selected courses and their quantities, and  calculates the total price.
